# scrape_Reuters_election_returns_live
A program to scrape election returns published by Reuters to compile them in a CSV in real time. 

This code scrapes Reuter's 2022 election results page, which updates as more ballots are cast, and compiles the results in a CSV for statistical analysis. By re-running code, election results update to reflect new vote counts.

**UPDATE 11/25/2022:** Now that election results simply await audits, I have stopped updating this file and have archived the pipeline. Those interested in learning how to build a scraper, however, are more than welcome to view the code!
